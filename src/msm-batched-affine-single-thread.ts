/**
 * MSM (multi-scalar multiplication)
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * given scalars `s_i` and points `G_i`, `i=0,...N-1`, compute
 *
 * `[s_0] G_0 + ... + [s_(N-1)] G_(N-1)`.
 *
 * broadly, our implementation uses the pippenger algorithm / bucket method, where scalars are sliced
 * into windows of size c, giving rise to K = [b/c] _partitions_ or "sub-MSMs" (where b is the scalar bit length).
 *
 * for each partition k, points `G_i` are sorted into `L = 2^(c-1)` _buckets_ according to the á¸±th NAF slice of their scalar `s_i`.
 * in total, we end up with `K*L` buckets, which are indexed by `(k, l)` where `k = 0,...K-1` and `l = 1,...,L`.
 *
 * after sorting the points, computation proceeds in **three main steps:**
 * 1. each bucket is accumulated into a single point, the _bucket sum_ `B_(l,k)`, which is simply the sum of all points in the bucket.
 * 2. the bucket sums of each partition k are reduced into a partition sum `P_k = 1*B_(k, 1) + 2*B_(k, 2) + ... + L*B_(k, L)`.
 * 3. the partition sums are reduced into the final result, `S = P_0 + 2^c*P_1 + ... + 2^(c*(K-1))*P_(K-1)`
 *
 * ### High-level implementation
 *
 * - we use **batch-affine additions** for step 1 (bucket accumulation),
 *   as pioneered by Zac Williamson in Aztec's barretenberg library: https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg/pull/19.
 *   thus, in this step we loop over all buckets, collect pairs of points to add, and then do a batch-addition on all of them.
 *   this is done in multiple passes, until the points of each bucket are summed to a single point, in an implicit binary tree.
 *   (in each pass, empty buckets and buckets with 1 remaining point are skipped;
 *   also, buckets of uneven length have a dangling point at the end, which doesn't belong to a pair and is skipped and included in a later pass)
 * - as a novelty, we also use **batch-affine additions for all of step 2** (bucket reduction).
 *   we achieve this by splitting up each partition recursively into sub-partitions, which are reduced independently from each other.
 *   this gives us enough independent additions to amortize the cost of the inversion in the batch-add step.
 *   sub-partitions are recombined in a series of comparatively cheap, log-sized steps. for details, see {@link reduceBucketsAffine}.
 * - we switch from an affine to a projective point representation between steps 2 and 3. step 3 is so tiny (< 0.1% of the computation)
 *   that the performance of projective curve arithmetic becomes irrelevant.
 *
 * the algorithm has a significant **preparation phase**, which happens before step 1, where we split scalars and sort points and such.
 * before splitting scalars into length-c slices, we do a **GLV decomposition**, where each 256-bit scalar is split into two
 * 128-bit chunks as `s = s0 + s1*lambda`. multiplying a point by `lambda` is a curve endomorphism,
 * with an efficient implementation `[lambda] (x,y) = (beta*x, y) =: endo((x, y))`,
 * where `lambda` and `beta` are certain cube roots of 1 in their respective fields.
 * correspondingly, each point `G` becomes two points `G`, `endo(G)`.
 * we also store `-G` and `-endo(G)` which are used when the NAF slices of `s0`, `s1` are negative.
 *
 * other than processing inputs, the preparation phase is concerned with organizing points. this should be done in a way which:
 * 1. enables to efficiently collect independent point pairs to add, in multiple successive passes over all buckets;
 * 2. makes memory access efficient when batch-adding pairs => ideally, the 2 points that form a pair, as well as consecutive pairs, are stored next to each other
 *
 * we address these two goals by copying all points to K independent linear arrays; one for each partition.
 * ordering in each of these arrays is achieved by performing a _counting sort_ of all points with respect to their bucket `l` in partition `k`.
 *
 * between step 1 and 2, there is a similar re-organization step. at the end of step 1, bucket sums are accumulated into the `0` locations
 * of each original bucket, which are spread apart as far as the original buckets were long.
 * before step 2, we copy bucket sums to a new linear array from 1 to L, for each partition.
 *
 * finally, here's a rough breakdown of the time spent in the 5 different phases of the algorithm.
 * we split the preparation phase into two; the "summation steps" are the three steps also defined above.
 *
 * ```txt
 *  8% - preparation 1 (input processing)
 * 12% - preparation 2 (sorting points in bucket order)
 * 65% - summation step 1 (bucket accumulation)
 * 15% - summation step 2 (bucket reduction)
 *  0% - summation step 3 (final sum over partitions)
 * ```
 *

     *
     * 1% bucket counts
     * 1% turn coordinates to montgomery form
     * 0.5% endomorphism
     * 0.5% split scalars to slices
     * 0.2% other processing of points (negation, copying)
     * 0.1% GLV-decompose scalar
     *
     * it's hard to get perfect data from the profiler because this phase is a hodgepodge of so many different small pieces.
     * also, there is ~2.7% of unexplained runtime which is spent somewhere in the JS logic.
     * that said, most of the effort here, like writing to wasm memory and processing points, is necessitated
     * by the architecture and can't be significantly reduced.

    /**
     * Preparation phase 2
     * -------------------
     *
     * this phase basically consists of the second and third loops of the _counting sort_ algorithm shown here:
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#Pseudocode
     *
     * we actually do K of these counting sorts -- one for each partition.
     *
     * note that the first loop in that link -- counting bucket sizes -- was already performed above,
     * and we have the `counts` stored in {@link bucketCounts}.
     *
     * here's how other parts of the linked algorithm correspond to our code:
     * - array `input`: in our case, this is the array of (scalar, point) pairs created in phase 1.
     *   note: when we say "array" here, we mean a range of memory locations which implicitly form an array.
     * - the `key(...)` function for mapping `input` elements to integer "keys":
     *   in our case, this is the function that computes the (kth) scalar slice belonging to each (scalar, point),
     *   i.e. {@link extractBitSlice} which we used above (loop 1) and which is re-executed in loop 3
     * - array `output`: in our case, we have one output array for each k. it's implicitly represented by a starting
     *   pointer which, right below, is stored at `buckets[k][0]`. by incrementing the pointer by the size of an affine point,
     *   we get to the next point.
     *
     * for our purposes, we don't only need sorting -- we also need to keep track of the indices
     * where one bucket ends and the next one begins, to form correct addition pairs.
     * these bucket bounds are stored in {@link buckets}.
     *
     * ## Performance
     *
     * this phase needs ~12% of total runtime (for 2^16 input points).
     *
     * this time is dominated by 8.5% for the {@link copyAffine} invocation at the end of 'loop #3'.
     * it writes to an unpredictable memory location (randomly distributed bucket) in each iteration.
     *
     * unfortunately, copying points scales superlinearly with input size:
     * for 2^18 input points, this phase already takes ~14% of runtime.
     *
     * as far as we can tell, this is still preferable to any other solutions we are aware of.
     * solutions that avoid the copying / sorting step seem to incur plenty of time for both random reads and
     * random writes during the bucket accumulation step, and end up being much slower -- especially or large inputs.
     * the counting sort solution almost entirely avoids random reads, with the exception of
     * reading random buckets from the relatively small {@link bucketCounts} helper array.
     *
     * there is not much other stuff happening in this phase:
     * - 'loop #2' is negligible at < 0.1% of runtime.
     * - 1-2% spent on {@link bucketCounts} reads/writes
     * - 0.5% on {@link extractBitSlice}
