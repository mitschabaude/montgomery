# Extra stuff

This folder contains miscellaneous code which either doesn't contribute to any core functionality of this library, or is that's not quite working, or has some other reason to be tucked away.

This also contains code that was once / could be again useful for testing and debugging, like the "dumb" MSM implementation based on JS bigints, non-batched affine additions and plain (non-pippenger) EC scalar multiplication.
